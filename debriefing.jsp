      <p>Thank you for your participation! In today's task you were asked to imagine two hypothetical scenarios in which a fellow group member committed a potentially disloyal action. In one of the scenarios your group had overcome significant challenges together in the past, while in the other scenario they had not. We predict that learning about a history of group struggle will lead people to view the same action as more immoral and disloyal than it would otherwise. </p>  
<p>Additionally, we predict that these differences may be exaggerated in individuals who care a great deal about loyalty. For example, prior research has shown that conservatives are more likely to view disloyal actions as immoral than liberals and we are interested in determining whether these effects are amplified by a history of group stuggle.
