        <p class="heading"></br></br> <b>Please take a moment to read over and carefully consider the following scenario...</b></br></br> Imagine that you are an employee at a Pharmaceutical company called Flaxo which is directly competing with another company called Kilo. John is one of your coworkers at Flaxo. Flaxo is currently doing a research trial on a new cancer treatment drug and the preliminary results indicate that the drug is not as effective as other medications currently on the market. The company's leadership knows that if these results are released to the press, the news would cause the stock price to plunge, and it would damage the company. They decide that since the findings are only preliminary, they have no obligation to release them to the press. However, John feels the company should be more transparent about the findings and feels that releasing the preliminary results might help the sick cancer patients find a better treatment option. <b> In the end, your coworker John decides to leak the preliminary results to the press. He sends a copy of the study to a reporter, anonymously, with a note explaining the study's significance. <b>
