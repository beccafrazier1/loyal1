        <p class="heading"></br></br> <b>Please take a moment to read over and carefully consider the following scenario...</b></br></br> Imagine that you are one of five children in a very close-knit family. You have two brothers and two sisters and the five of you have become very close friends in addition to being family. When you were ten years old, your parents were in a terrible car accident. Your mother was killed, and your father was paralyzed from the waist down, and confined to a wheel chair. The accident was devastating to your family, but it forced you and your siblings to learn how to care for one another and how to support yourselves by working odd jobs. Together you've been through bad times and good times, and these experiences have brought you closer over the years.

 </br></br>Your younger brother John is a hiring manager at a company called Orion and has been looking to hire a new research analyst. Your older brother Fred is currently unemployed and is applying for the research analyst position at Orion. Unfortunately, there is another more qualified candidate who is also applying for the position. <b>  In the end, your younger brother John decides not to hire your older brother Fred.<b>
 </br></br>  After you've imagined this scenario and considered John's actions, press the continue button when it appears below. </p>
