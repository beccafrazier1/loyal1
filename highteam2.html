        <p class="heading"></br></br> <b>Please take a moment to read over and carefully consider the following scenario...</b></br></br> Imagine that you are a member of a recreational co-ed soccer team called the Eagles which is directly competing with another team called the Strikers. John is one of your team members on the Eagles and has been on the team with you for the past five years. The two of you were founding members of the team and you've been through a lot together. Last year your team lost its star player to a knee injury, and then did so poorly that it was almost forced down into a lower league. However, in the face of this threat your team really banded together. Everyone agreed to put a lot more time into training, and the hard work is starting to pay off. You were able to greatly improve your performance and now it's looking like you might even make it to the league championship. </br></br> John is a strong asset to your team but has recently been offered an opportunity to have more playing time if he switches to the Strikers. If John accepts the offer it will be personally beneficial to him but your team could really suffer in return. <b>In the end, your teammate John decides to switch to the Strikers.  <b> 
 </br></br>  After you've imagined this scenario and considered John's actions, press the continue button when it appears below. </p>
